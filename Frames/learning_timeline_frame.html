        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
            I first learned how to code around this time. I took
            a course called COP 3223C Introduction to Programming
            with C. At the time, I was an Aerospace Engineering major
            at the University of Central Florida, I recall having so much
            fun doing the assignments for this course that I had to switch
            my major to something that directly dealt with coding. I
            looked into the Computer Engineering and Computer Science majors,
            and ultimately decided to take Computer Science.

            During this semester, I became familiar with font-end web
            technologies. I learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript and created
            my first website. The website was mostly made in HTML and CSS,
            no JavaScript. I also decided to start learning Data Structures
            and algorithms in Python. I decided that python was a very
            important language to learn because it is widely used today in
            many backend infrastructures.
        </p><br>

        <p>
            I joined an organization called SHPE USF, they have a website
            called <a href="http://shpeusf.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SHPEUSF.com</a>. When I
            joined, the
            website was not mobile friendly, so my priority was to
            make it mobile friendly. The website was coded using jQuery and
            Bootstrap, so I had to become comfortable with those two
            libraries/frameworks in order to make it fully mobile. Another
            contribution that I've made to this organization, was that I
            helped the tech group move the website's code from google docs
            to github.
        </p><br>

        <p>
            I participated in a hackathon (called hackabull). It was my
            first hackathon, so my team did not make it to the top 3
            teams. My team created a web app that helps students organize
            the URLs for their online courses, organize their assignments
            for their classes and a feature that allows students to use the
            Pomodoro method to help students focus. Although my team did not
            place top 3, I became familiar with backend technologies, I had
            a general idea of what to learn for the backend.
        </p><br>

        <p>
            I'm already comfortable with frontend technologies,
            so in the future, I want to start learning some backend stuff.
            I've already started learning the basics of Nodejs, SQL and
            MySql. I also want to become familiar with the following
            frameworks: Express.js and react. Moreover, I hope to do a
            co-op or internship in Summer 2021 or Fall 2021.

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 135px;">Was first Introduced to coding</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 110px;">Learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 145px;">Made a website mobile friendly</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 90px;">
            Worked with a group of 4 to create a web app. Also gained
            a sense of direction on how to learn the backend.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 125px;">
            Learn more about the backend and some frameworks.
